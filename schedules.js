      title:"The Remarkable Jones Strong Distribution Hilbert Space",
      description:"The purpose of this talk is to construct a new Hilbert space, \\(SD^2 (\\mathbb{R}^3 )\\) . This space provides the basis for a rigorous development of Feynman's path integral formulation of quantum mechanics and the Heisenberg and Schr&#246;dinger theories. The standard space used \\(L^2 (\\mathbb{R}^3)\\), allows for the Heisenberg and Schr&#246;dinger formulations, but does not allow for Feynman&#8217;s formulation. We call it the Jones strong distribution Hilbert space, after Frank Jones of Rice University, because we use a remarkable function discovered by him. Our new space \(SD^2 (\mathbb{R}^3 )\) also contains the \\(D'[\\mathbb{R}^3 ]\\) , the spaces of Schwartz distributions, the kernel for the Feynman path integral and the Dirac delta function as norm bounded function."
